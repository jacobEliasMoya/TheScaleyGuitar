                The 
                <span style="color: yellow; font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Locrian </span>
                scale, or mode, is the seventh of the seven musical
                modes. It is similar to the natural minor scale except
                for the lowered second and fifth. The 
                <span style="color: yellow; font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Locrian </span>
                scale is
                the minor scale that appears when a major scale is played 
                with the seventh note (seventh scale-degree) as the root.
                Thus, a C major scale played from "B" is a B 
                <span style="color: yellow; font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Locrian </span>
                scale.
                This is why the term "mode" is more appropriate than "scale".

        <p>
            Below is a diagram showing the intervals of the major scale. Each yellow box can be seen as a 
            degree of the major scale, so each one also represents a mode, from 1 (Ionian) to 7 (
                <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Locrian</span>
            ) and then back to 1 again.
            The numerals correspond to the chord/mode number 1-7. You can also see that the maj/min label
            corresponds with the chord/mode type (the triad around which the mode is built). For example, 
            3rd mode Phrygian is a minor mode, so therefore the 3 (iii) chord will also be minor. 4th mode 
            Lydian is a major mode, so therefore the 4 (IV) chord will also be major! 
            It's just like superimposing chords onto the mode patterns, 
            using some or all of the mode's tones in the chord.

        <p>
            Because you can never really resolve a chord progression to a diminished tonic (it sounds too unresolved), 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Locrian</span>
            is most commonly used to compliment diminished chords as a bridge between two more stable chords. 
            The diminished flavour acts predominantly as a natural, passing link to the major tonic of the chord progression
            (which is C major in this case). It also acts as a natural, passing link to Aeolian (minor) of the same key.
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Locrian</span>
            can complement that movement over the leading diminished chord.
