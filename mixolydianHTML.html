                <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Mixolydian</span>
                mode is the fifth mode of the major scale. The interval formula is root (1), second (2), 
                major third (3), fourth (4), fifth (5), sixth (6) and minor seventh (b7). It has the same notes as the
                 Ionian mode, except the minor seventh (b7), it is considered a major scale. The 
                 <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Mixolydian</span> 
                 mode can be used over any non-altered dominant chord as dom7, dom9, dom11, dom13, 7sus4. The Dominant scale 
                 is the another name for the 
                 <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Mixolydian</span> 
                 mode. It is called " dominant" because it is built from the 5th degree of the major scale also called "dominant". The                  
                 <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Mixolydian</span> 
                 mode is widely used in jazz and blues music for improvising over dominant chords. It is one of the 
                 <span style="color: red;">MOST</span> 
                 important scale to know.

        </h1>

        <p>
            Let's first get familiar with the building blocks 
            that give 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Mixolydian</span>
            its unique sound. 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Mixolydian</span>
 
            can be seen as just another type of major scale 
            (a scale that includes the intervals 1 3 5), with its 
            defining interval/tone being the minor 7th (b7). Many 
            musicians associate that flat 7th with a "country"
            or "bluesy" feel which gives Mixolydian, as a scale,
            its distinctive flavour. It's the b7 that differs 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Mixolydian</span>
 
            from the natural major scale (Ionian), which uses a major 7th (7).

        <p>
            As 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Mixolydian</span>
            is the 5th mode of the major scale, you can also use your knowledge 
            of the major scale's patterns to cover more of the fretboard. Each 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Mixolydian</span>
            root 
            has a relative major scale root meaning, if you already know the major scale, all 
            you need to do to is learn the corresponding root positions as shown in the table 
            below. For example, if you wanted to play G 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Mixolydian</span>
            , you could simply play it's 
            parent scale, C major (as they both contain the same seven notes). 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Mixolydian</span>
            and 
            major scale relative roots This way, you 
            <span style="color: red;">ONLY</span> 
            have to spend time learning one scale 
            (the major scale) across the entire fretboard on different roots and you'll 
            automatically know its seven modes starting from their related major scale degrees 
            (e.g. 5th mode                 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Mixolydian<'s/span>
            root is the major scale's 5th note).
