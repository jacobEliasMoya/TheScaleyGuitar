                Music that uses the traditional major scale can be said to be in the 
                first mode of the major scale, also known as 
                <span style="color: yellow; font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Ionian</span>. 
                Its bright sounding is well-liked in pop, rock, classical, jazz, 
                punk and country. The 
                <span style="color: yellow; font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Ionian</span>
                Mode is exactly the same as the Major scale.
                It is used in the same way but can be called the 
                <span style="color: yellow; font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Ionian</span>
                Mode if 
                you are playing over a static (<span style="color:red">not</span> changing) chord. 
                It makes 
                <span style="color:red">no</span> difference if you think of it as the Major Scale or the 
                <span style="color: yellow; font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Ionian</span>

                mode.

                The perfect fourth interval of this scale (in this case F) can sound somewhat 
                unstable as it often pulls to the third of the chord (in this case E). 
                Some jazz school have people practice using the Ionian mode without playing the 
                4th degree at all (They call it an 'avoid note'). Personally, I quite like the sound
                 of passing through the note, it's just stopping on it that sounds a bit horrible. 
                Like with all theory stuff, you <span style="color:red">MUST</span> try it and hear it for yourself or it
                 will 
                 really make sense.

            A great way to work on playing in the 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Ionian </span>mode
            is to play G 
            major scale over a 1 4 5 chord progression in the key of G. 
            Since we are in the key of G major, the 1 4 5 progression would be
             G major, C major and D major. This 1 4 5 progression
            really hints at the 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Ionian</span>
            mode and lends itself to 
            experimenting with expressing the 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Ionian</span>
            Mode sound. 
            Recording these chords over and over again and 
            then play them back. Try to improvise with the 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Ionian</span>
            scale. 
            Listen to what each scale degree sounds like over each chord. Play the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th scale 
            degrees and just listen to how they sound. Now play the 
            4th and see how it sounds over each chord. 
            If you start to memorize what each note sounds like 
            you will start to be able to know exactly when to use 
            specific notes. Have fun and get the 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Ionian</span>
            sound in your head.
