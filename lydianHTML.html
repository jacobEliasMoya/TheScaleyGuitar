                <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Lydian </span>
                can be considered in a number of ways...As a seven-tone scale we can use to 
                accompany major and major 7th chords.As a harmonic system and mode of the major scale.
                But more broadly, 
                <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Lydian </span>
                encompasses a specific musical flavour that composers 
                use to evoke certain emotions and feelings. The 
                <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Lydian </span>
                mode is cool because it doesn't 
                really have the avoid note like the Major scale (in which the natural 4th is not really
                a nice sound, clashes with the 3rd of the chord). The #4 degree is dissonant but sounds
                cool, not wrong. Many people use this instead of the major scale where there is an 
                unrelated Major Chord, and even sometimes when it's a I chord in a key

                The 
                <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Lydian </span>
                Mode is type of major scale (it has a natural 3rd) and is in fact only one note 
                different to the major scale - it has a #4 scale degree. This is a very cool sound. You 
                can also think of the 
                <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Lydian </span>
                mode as being based off of the 4th scale degree of any major 
                scale. In other words if you went to the 4th degree of any major scale and started playing 
                from there, you would be in the 
                <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Lydian </span>
                mode. Let’s stick with our A major scale for an example. 
                D is the 4th scale degree in the A major scale. If you started on a D and played an A major scale, 
                you would be playing a D 
                <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Lydian </span>
                scale. It doesn’t matter which way you choose to think about it 
                because the important thing is to be able to hear and express what the 
                <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Lydian </span>
                mode sounds like.

                The notes that really define the Lydian mode are the 1st, 3rd, and raised 4th scale degrees. 
                The 1st gives us our tonal center or starting point and the 3rd gives us the major sounding quality. 
                The raised 4th scale degree is really the note that gives the Lydian mode it’s defining sound.

                <span style="color:red">FUN FACT:</span>
                <br>
                Think about the theme song for “
                <span style="color:yellow">The Simpsons</span>
                ”. This is probably the best know Lydian sounding 
                melody in the world. The whole tone scale is something that I always think of when I hear the 
                Lydian scale too.
