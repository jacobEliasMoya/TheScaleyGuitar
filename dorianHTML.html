             is like any other scale - <br> it has it's own melodic flavour and can be played over chords and certain progressions. 
             This lesson will not only show you the essential patterns and theory for playing             
             <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Dorian </span>, 
             but you'll also learn, through the aid of ear training audio and backing tracks, when it sounds good to use.
            Before you start with the presentation below, make sure you have a basic knowledge of the major scale (as             <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Dorian </span>
            is one of its modes).
    
            So this is <span style="color:red;">not</span>  for beginners, but I've tried to break it down as simplistically as possible. A lot of this is about ear training, so you rely less on charts to tell you what to play

        </h1>

        <p>
            First, get to know the intervals of 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Dorian </span>
            . <br> These are the building blocks that give 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Dorian </span> its unique sound. 
            As a minor scale (1 â™­3 5), it's the major 6th (6) interval that gives it its special quality.
            So when you correspond the root (1) of the scale with the minor chord you're playing over (e.g. D 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Dorian </span>
            over Dm) and emphasise that major 6th, you'll instantly hear             
            <span style="color: yellow;font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Dorian's </span>
            color.

        <p>
            As 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Dorian </span>
            is the 2nd mode of the major scale, you can also use your knowledge of 
            the major scale's patterns to cover more of the fretboard. 
            To do this, simply visualise your major scale root one whole step (or two frets) down from the 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Dorian </span>
            root. 
            For example, D 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Dorian </span>
            uses the same notes as C major. A 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Dorian </span>
            uses the same notes as G major. 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Dorian </span>
            and major scale relative roots This way, you only have to spend time learning one scale (the major scale) 
            across the entire fretboard and you'll automatically know its seven modes starting from 
            their related major scale degrees (e.g. 2nd mode 
            <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Dorian's </span>
            root is the major scale's 2nd note).
