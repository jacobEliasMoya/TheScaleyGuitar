                This is the most common scale in blues, pop and rock music.It is easy to learn and
                is essential for learning to improvise in a blues style. ‘Penta' means five and 
                ‘tonic' means note, so ‘
                <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;"> Minor Pentatonic</span> 
                Scale' really just means ‘Minor Five-Note
                Scale'. The reason we learn scales is that they are groups of notes that sound 
                really good together that we can use to make up solos (as in lead guitar) and
                melodies. We'll get to that later on. They are also great for developing your 
                technique for playing single notes, so they are an important part of your 
                development as a guitar player.

                The 
                <span style="color: yellow;     font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Minor Pentatonic</span> 
                works predominantly over minor chords due to its minor 3rd interval. 
                Let's have a play around with the boxed patterns to begin with. The 
                idea is not just to play it in sequence, from root to root, but rather 
                skip around the scale and find interesting hooks and phrases. Move up 
                and down the scale, vertically and horizontally. Many guitarists use the 
                "call and response" technique, which is where you play a phrase that sounds unresolved 
                (e.g. it might have the characteristics of asking a question), then you "respond"
                 with a more resolving phrase (e.g. a sequence that ends on the root note or another "safe note").
            </p>

                Other safe target notes for your phrases are the 
                minor 3rd and 5th of the scale. Incidentally, these 
                are referred to as "chord tones" because they make up
                the minor triad (1 b3 5). Targetting chord tones 
                helps to keep your solos connected to the backing music.

                <span style="color: red;">Remember That!</span> <br> 
                Another common technique is to stagger 
                your way up or down the scale in a run. This is where 
                you move up and/or down a scale in a repetitive sequence.
